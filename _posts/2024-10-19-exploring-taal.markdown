<p> Before the pandemic, Volcano Island in the middle of Taal Lake was accessible to everyone. Local residents and tourists alike flocked to this island to experience the thrill of climbing the inner volcano. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into my unforgettable trip to Volcano Island, nestled within the active Taal Volcano. </p>

<p> My journey began in Tagaytay, a city known for its stunning view of Taal Volcano. </p>

<p> From there, I took a motorized boat, locally known as a bangka, across Taal Lake to reach Volcano Island.</p>

<p> Upon arrival, I was greeted by the warm and friendly community residing there.</p>

<p> To reach the summit of the inner volcano, visitors had two options: a scenic walk or a horseback ride.</p>
